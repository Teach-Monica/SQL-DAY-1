The Media table holds information about each video or image associated with a movie, including its URL and type (e.g., "trailer," "poster," "screenshot").
The Genre table holds information about each genre, such as its name.
The Movie_Genre table connects movies to genres, allowing a movie to belong to multiple genres.
The Review table holds information about each user's review of a movie, including their rating and comments.
The User table holds information about each user, such as their username and email address.
The Artist table holds information about each artist, including their name and bio.
The Skill table holds information about each skill an artist can have, such as "actor," "director," or "cinematographer."
